  Week 1
- I learned about how to use proposition.
   Ex: x>10 at x=3. It is a proposition with a truth value false
- I must practice in much challenging problems for the preparation for the upcoming quiz.

Week 2
- I learned how to use Negation, Conjuncton and Disjunction
- I am a bit confused with the use of Exclusive or
- In the usage of Conditional all I remembered was: 
   If p<=q , then 1
- I learned Biconditional operator: 
  p is true iff you have the same truth values
  We were introduced to Logical Equivalences
- There were a lot operations to use in this topic.
- I learned about Identity, Domination, Negation, Double Negation
- I was really confused how to use the laws like De Morgan's, Distributive
- We proved ¬(p v (¬p ∧ q)) ≡ (¬p ∧ ¬q), there were a lot of laws used to prove this equation
- I learned about Converse, Inverse and Contrapositive
- Tautology is term used if the statement is always true
- I learned about predicate Logic:
-   Ex: In the statement "x is greater than 12", the variable "x" is the subject and "is greater than 12" is the predicate
- I learned about Quantifiers: 
-  Existential quantifier if there exist a possible value in the statement 
-  Universal quantifier if the statement is true for all possible values
   
  Week 3
- I learned about the Rules of Inference
- I learned that argument is a sentence of statemets that end with a conclusion.
- I also learned about fallacy - it is a common form of incorrect reasoning which lead to invalid arguments.
- I learned about Modus Ponens, Modus tollens.
- I'm a bit confused with Hypothetical cyllogism and Disjunctive cyllogism.
-  We were introduced to the use of Addition, Simplication, Conjunction and Resolution
 
   Week 4
- We have discussed a bit about the Superman problem, each of the statements in that problem were broken down.
- It lead to the answer that Superman does not exist.
- We were introduced to the first proof--Direct Proof
- In using Direct proof we must assume p=T and show that q=T using eq1.

  Week 5
- We have discussed about Proof by Contradiction.
- This topic is a bit more confusing than the first proofs
- We were introduced to Mathematical Induction
- In using Mathematical Induction, you have to assign the basis of the steps you are doing.
- Next is you must perform the Inductive step, I think its another form for Direct proof.
- It was confusing
- Sir told us to study about Program Correctness because it will appear in Quiz 1.

  Week 6
- Sir introduced to a new topic, Set theory.
- Set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, which may be anything(including other sets)
- Sir taught us about set builder notations and using venn diagram
- We have discussed about types of functions
-   1. One to one function- never assign the same value to two different domain elements
-   2. Onto function-Functions that has equal range and co-domain.
-    ex: Dapat may at least 8 students para lahat may grade (0.0,1.0,1.5,...4.0)
-   3. One-to-one Correspondence-Pag parehas one-to-one at onto, automatic bijective.

  Week 7
- We have tackled about Algorithm. I was late when Sir introduced algorithm in our class.
- You must put the Procedure,Input ,Output and the Body. In short the Pseudocode in making algorithm.
- The properties of Algorithm are Correctness,Finiteness and Generality.
- Sir taught us to use while loop if the operation is not predictable and use for loop is the operation is predictable

Week 8
- Sir taught us about Binary and Linear Search Algorithm.
- We have discussed about Bubble Sort and insertion Sort.
- we also discussed about Greedy Algorithm:
- Sir introduced about the coin change (67 centavos)
- His question was 'What is the maximum number of coins in terms of: Quarters,DImes,Nickel,Penny'.
- We were introduced to a new topic: Big O notation- it is the upper bound of the function
- The function should be multiplied to a constant to make it upper bound.
- Sir taught us also about Big Omega, the lower bound
- He also taught us about Big theta, for both upper and lower bound
   
Week 9
- I was absent during this day. My classmates told me that Sir discussed about Time Complexity
- I need to get some notes and review this topic.


Week 10

| Complexity | Terminology |
| :---: | :---: |
| ϴ(1) | constant complexity |
| ϴ(log n) | log complexity |
| ϴ(n) | linear complexity |
| ϴ(n log n) | n log n complexity |
| ϴ(n^b) | polynomial complexity |
| ϴ(b^n) | exponential complexity |
| ϴ(n!) | factorial complexity |
- I studied about time complexity because I was absent last week.
- I tried to understand the lesson but it is still hard to understand Time Complexity
- My classmates told me that Sir taught them about the iteration table
- Sir taught a new topic about Graph Theory
- Sir told us that it was easier than the previous topics
- A graph includes vertices and edges.
- Sir told us about Handshaking Theorem:
    G=(V,E) be an undirected graph with e edges, then
    2e = summation of deg (v) ; where e-edges, deg-degree, v-vertices
- We have tackeled about Euler Circuit and Euler Path
- It has an Euler path if a graph has exacly 2 nodes,vertices with odd degree (starting point yung isang node na may odd tapos end point yung isang node na may odd degree)
- It has an Euler Circuit iff a graph has even degree for all nodes/vertices
- We also tackled about Hamilton Path and Hamilton Circuit
- The only difference between Eulerian and Hamitonian is Euler is for edges and Hamilton is nodes/vertices
- We have discussed about Matrices of Graphs, the Adjacench Matrix, it is all about conncections
- We also discussed about Isomorphism and Homeomorphism of Graphs.
- We also discussed about Planar Graphs
- We also discussed about Kuratowski's Theorem: The K3,3 and the K,5
- The Kuratowski's Theorem determines if a graph is planar or non planar
