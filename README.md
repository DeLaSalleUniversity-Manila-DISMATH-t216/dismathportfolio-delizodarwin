 Week 1
- I learned about how to use proposition.
   Ex: x>10 at x=3. It is a proposition with a truth value false
- I must practice in much challenging problems for the preparation for the upcoming quiz.

 Week 2
- I learned how to use Negation, Conjuncton and Disjunction
- I am a bit confused with the use of Exclusive or
- In the usage of Conditional all I remembered was: 
   If p<=q , then 1
- I learned Biconditional operator: 
  p is true iff you have the same truth values
  We were introduced to Logical Equivalences
- There were a lot operations to use in this topic.
- I learned about Identity, Domination, Negation, Double Negation
