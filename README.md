  Week 1
- I learned about how to use proposition.
   Ex: x>10 at x=3. It is a proposition with a truth value false
- I must practice in much challenging problems for the preparation for the upcoming quiz.

Week 2
- I learned how to use Negation, Conjuncton and Disjunction
- I am a bit confused with the use of Exclusive or
- In the usage of Conditional all I remembered was: 
   If p<=q , then 1
- I learned Biconditional operator: 
  p is true iff you have the same truth values
  We were introduced to Logical Equivalences
- There were a lot operations to use in this topic.
- I learned about Identity, Domination, Negation, Double Negation
- I was really confused how to use the laws like De Morgan's, Distributive
- We proved ¬(p v (¬p ∧ q)) ≡ (¬p ∧ ¬q), there were a lot of laws used to prove this equation
- I learned about Converse, Inverse and Contrapositive
- Tautology is term used if the statement is always true
- I learned about predicate Logic:
-   Ex: In the statement "x is greater than 12", the variable "x" is the subject and "is greater than 12" is the predicate
- I learned about Quantifiers: 
-   Ex: Existential if there exist a possible value in the statement while Universal if the statement is true for all possible values.
-   
  Week 3
- I learned about the Rules of Inference
- I learned that argument is a sentence of statemets that end with a conclusion.
- I also learned about fallacy - it is a common form of incorrect reasoning which lead to invalid arguments.
- I learned about Modus Ponens, Modus tollens.
- I'm a bit confused with Hypothetical cyllogism and Disjunctive cyllogism.
- We were introduced to the use of Addition, Simplication, Conjunction and Resolution.
- 
   Week 4
- We have discussed a bit about the Superman problem, each of the statements in that problem were broken down.
- It lead to the answer that Superman does not exist.
- We were introduced to the first proof--Direct Proof
- In using Direct proof we must assume p=T and show that q=T using eq1.
